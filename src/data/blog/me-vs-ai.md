I've been hesitant to look into AI.

I use it every day to code but I treat it as a black box. I don't have a strong understanding of whats going on under the hood and haven't needed to. The truth is you can get by downloading Cursor or asking ChatGPT whatever you need.

After five years at BuildZoom, I'm looking for a new job. Understanding Machine Learning is now an unspoken, default requirement just like being able to write a SQL query or sort an array.

That's why im going to attempt [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html). It's a good mixture of practical and conceptual. It also doesn't require me to revisit a bunch of math I haven't done in a while.

To clarify, the goal is not to become an ML engineer. It's just to understand whats going on.
