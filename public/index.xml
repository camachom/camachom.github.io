      <description>I googled hoare partition quicksort javascript and tested the implementation of the top three results. To validate correctness, I used LeetCode&amp;rsquo;s Sorting test suite.
In defense of the authors I purposely ignored any context the authors might have disclosed in their text. The idea was to get the code to run as quickly as possible with the least amount of modifications. I was trying to mimic a copy-paste frenzied developer who had exhausted their patience and whose tunnel vision had limited their typing to Command-C/Command-V.</description>

      <title>Deceptively Simple System of Equations</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently taking Differnetial Equations, and I have never felt more mathy. That dosen&amp;rsquo;t mean I don&amp;rsquo;t occasionally get stuck on simple algebra. Consider these equations from a homework problem:
$$ 2a_{2} + 3a_{1}x + 4a_{0} = 0 $$
$$ a_{2} + a_{1} + a_{0} = 1 $$
$$ \text{where (a_{2}, a_{1}, a_{0}) are constants} $$
System of equations are introduced in high school, so I&amp;rsquo;ve solved tons of these problems before using the elimination technique (I don&amp;rsquo;t know any Linear Algebra yet).</description>

      <description>When lockdown began, I was let go of my job. I wanted to be physically active, but I was recovering from a knee injury which kept me from riding my bike. A personal situation produced so much anxiety I was unable to focus on interviewing or anything that wasn&amp;rsquo;t my anxiety. All my routines that kept my day-to-day healthy and productive were no longer possible.
I knew I would eventually get back on track, but I needed a distraction to get me through the immediate chaos.</description>
