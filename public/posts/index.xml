      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently taking Differential Equations, and I have never felt more mathy. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I don&amp;rsquo;t occasionally get stuck on simple algebra. Consider these equations from a homework problem:&#xA;$$ 2a_{2} + 3a_{1}x + 4a_{0} = 0 $$&#xA;$$ a_{2} + a_{1} + a_{0} = 1 $$&#xA;$$ \text{where } a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2} \text{ are constants} $$&#xA;System of equations are introduced in high school, so I&amp;rsquo;ve solved tons of these problems before using the elimination technique (I don&amp;rsquo;t know any Linear Algebra yet).</description>

      <description>After attending a coding bootcamp, I wanted to go back to school. But why? Am I not a great example of how traditional education has failed to catch on to industry needs?</description>
