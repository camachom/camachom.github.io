    <h1>How I Made $16.67 Playing Chess Online</h1>

    

    <p>When lockdown began, I was let go of my job. I wanted to be physically active, but I was recovering from a knee injury which kept me from riding my bike. A personal situation produced so much anxiety I was unable to focus on interviewing or anything that wasn&rsquo;t my anxiety. All my routines that kept my day-to-day healthy and productive were no longer possible.</p>
<p>I knew I would eventually get back on track, but I needed a distraction to get me through the immediate chaos. Video games felt wasteful, and I couldn&rsquo;t focus on books. Then I stumbled onto chess through a couple of streamers on Twitch.</p>
<p>I started studying seriously, and playing for at least four hours a day on Chess.com. I spent so much time staring at the board, I came up with my own mini game. With every opponent, I tried to guess their nationality based on the flag next to their username. Never thought I would play against someone from Palestine or Uzbekistan. I even learned about countries that I had never heard of like Mauritius.</p>
<p>After a couple of months, I was still enjoying the game and slowly increasing my online rating. It became a tool to fight my anxiety, and part of my new daily routine. However, as much as I loved chess, playing alone in my room started to feel empty. I have no professional chess aspirations, but I wanted to feel like I was building up to something.</p>
<p>I decided to participate in an online USCF rated tournament (which simply means it&rsquo;s officially recognized). There were monetary prizes for the top players making it even more competitive.</p>
<p>Turns out I performed well and tied for second place in my division earning me <code>$16.67</code>! A hilariously random amount. My assumption is that second place was awarded $40.00, but because of the tie it had to be split in two. And then taxes?</p>
<p>The fee to play was <code>$40.00</code>, so I was at a net loss, but something more important had happened. The experience demonstrated that all my work paid off. I was competitive in my division, and felt that I could fit in as a member of my local chess club.</p>
<p>The point is this can happen with any pursuit you undertake in isolation. Iâ€™ve found myself in similar situations learning music, math and building software. If you start plateauing or feeling dissatisfied with a meaningful project during lockdown, try finding a way to share it. External validation can be powerful when youâ€™re alone in your room.</p>
