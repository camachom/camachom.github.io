    <h1>Deceptively Simple System of Equations</h1>

    

    <p>I&rsquo;m currently taking Differential Equations, and I have never felt more mathy. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t occasionally get stuck on simple algebra. Consider these equations from a homework problem:</p>
<p>$$
2a_{2} + 3a_{1}x + 4a_{0} = 0
$$</p>
<p>$$
a_{2} + a_{1} + a_{0} = 1
$$</p>
<p>$$
\text{where } a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2} \text{ are constants}
$$</p>
<p>System of equations are introduced in high school, so I&rsquo;ve solved tons of these problems before using the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-system-of-equations/alg-equivalent-systems-of-equations/v/solving-systems-of-equations-by-elimination">elimination technique</a> (I don&rsquo;t know any Linear Algebra yet).</p>
<p>I had given up on this problem until my professor (and a friend) showed me a couple of tricks.</p>
<p>$$
2a_{2} + 3a_{1}x + 4a_{0} = 3a_{1}x + (2a_{2} + 4a_{0}) = 0
$$</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that this function is a 1st degree polynomial. That means:</p>
<p>$$
3a_{1}x + (2a_{2} + 4a_{0}) = 0x + 0
$$</p>
<p>The coefficients in a polynomial are just constants. Consider (3a_{1}x). The coefficient (3a_{1}) is just some number (like 5 or 100), and can never be something like (1/x) and cancel out (x). Similarly, combining (2a_{2} + 4a_{0}) will always result in a number since two constants can&rsquo;t result in an (x) or (x^2) for example.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only way to get (0x) is if (3a_{1} = 0). And the only way to get (0) (referring to the last term of the equation on the right) is if (2a_{2} + 4a_{0} = 0).</p>
<p>The pattern should be apparent now. For every term of degree (n), we equate the coefficient of the left side to the coefficient on right side of the equation:</p>
<p>$$
3a_{1} = 0
$$</p>
<p>Where (3a_{1}) is the coefficient of (3a_{1}x) and (0) is the coefficient of (0x).</p>
<p>$$
2a_{2} + 4a_{0} = 0
$$</p>
<p>Where (2a_{2} + 4a_{0}) and (0) are the constants being added to both equations.</p>
<p>The rest of this problem is familiar territory. By simplifying the equations above, we get:</p>
<p>$$
a_{1} = 0
$$</p>
<p>$$
a_{2} = -2a_{0}
$$</p>
<p>If we plug these values into the original equation ((a_{2} + a_{1} + a_{0} = 1)), we get:</p>
<p>$$
-2a_{0} + 0 + a_{0} = 1
$$</p>
<p>And we finally get the answer!</p>
<p>$$
a_{0} = -1
$$</p>
<p>$$
a_{1} = 0
$$</p>
<p>$$
a_{2} = 2
$$</p>
