    <p>Day one of learning about neural networks, so this could be misguided.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, I had to make a hard decision. I’m unsure to this day whether I did the right thing. The confusion lingered enough that I ended up reading about hard decisions, including Ruth Chang’s work on the topic.</p>
<p>Chang argues that once the standard reasons (those dictated by society, morality, or third parties) run out, it’s up to the rational agent to generate reasons. Those self-authored reasons are what make you who you are.</p>
<p>I agree with her claim that hard decisions are not about choosing between equivalent alternatives. If two options were truly equivalent, the decision would be trivial. Leaving a meaningful decision to chance would be absurd in almost any real-world scenario.</p>
<p>That said, my own decision-making process in this case looked different. I gravitated toward one alternative almost immediately and only afterward tried to rationalize it. There was never a genuine internal debate or a pros-and-cons list. It would have been useless. I was already biased and heavily leaning one way.</p>
<p>This pattern is well known in psychology and is often summarized by the claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Most intelligence happens below awareness.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A classic example is chess. Strong players often feel that a tactic exists in a position before they can articulate it, and only then search for the concrete continuation.</p>
<p>So where does AI come in?</p>
<p>Hidden layers in neural networks are famously opaque. It’s often unclear what level of abstraction they operate on. Even when a network produces the correct output, explaining how it arrived there may be difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>By the time a signal reaches the output layer, the original evidence has been abstracted, compressed, and transformed to the point of unintelligibility. What remains is something closer to a conclusion than an argument. It resembles a kind of artificial gut feeling.</p>
<p>In that sense, explicit reasoning isn’t the source of many decisions. It’s often a post-hoc narrative we tell ourselves once the decision has already been made.</p>
<p>Humans are obviously far more complex, but the comparison is still useful. There’s nothing mystical about gut feelings: they’re conclusions (potentially rational, based on pattern recognition, etc.) where the evidence is no longer available.</p>
