    <h1>Me vs AI</h1>

    

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been hesitant to look into AI.</p>
<p>I use it every day to code but I treat it as a black box. I don&rsquo;t have a strong understanding of whats going on under the hood and haven&rsquo;t needed to. The truth is you can get by downloading Cursor or asking ChatGPT whatever you need.</p>
<p>After five years at BuildZoom, I&rsquo;m looking for a new job. Understanding Machine Learning is now an unspoken, default requirement just like being able to write a SQL query or sort an array.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why im going to attempt <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a>. It&rsquo;s a good mixture of practical and conceptual. It also doesn&rsquo;t require me to revisit a bunch of math I haven&rsquo;t done in a while.</p>
<p>To clarify, the goal is not to become an ML engineer. It&rsquo;s just to understand whats going on.</p>
